# 20483 - Training - Programming in C#
Training for Microsoft Official Course (MOC) 20483 Programming in C

<br>

### About the course
This training course teaches developers the programming skills that are required for developers to create Windows applications using the Visual C# language.  
During their five days in the classroom students review the basics of Visual C# program structure, language syntax, and implementation details, and then consolidate their knowledge throughout the week as they build an application that incorporates several features of the .NET Framework 4.7.

<br>

### Audience profile
 * This course is intended for experienced developers who already have programming experience in C, C++, JavaScript, Objective-C, Microsoft Visual Basic, or Java and understand the concepts of object-oriented programming.
* This course is not designed for students who are new to programming; it is targeted at professional developers with at least one month of experience programming in an object-oriented environment.
At course completion

### After completing this course, students will be able to:
* Describe the core syntax and features of Visual C#.
* Create methods, handle exceptions, and describe the monitoring requirements of large-scale applications.
* Implement the basic structure and essential elements of a typical desktop application.
* Create classes, define and implement interfaces, and create and use generic collections.
* Use inheritance to create a class hierarchy and to extend a .NET Framework class.
* Read and write data by using file input/output and streams, and serialize and deserialize data in different formats.
* Create and use an entity data model for accessing a database and use LINQ to query data.
* Access and query remote data by using the types in the System.Net namespace and WCF Data Services.
* Build a graphical user interface by using XAML.
* Improve the throughput and response time of applications by using tasks and asynchronous operations.
* Integrate unmanaged libraries and dynamic components into a Visual C# application.
* Examine the metadata of types by using reflection, create and use custom attributes, generate code at runtime, and manage assembly versions.
* Encrypt and decrypt data by using symmetric and asymmetric encryption.

#### Prerequisites
Developers attending this course should already have gained some limited experience using C# to complete basic programming tasks.   
More specifically, students should have hands-on experience using C# that demonstrates their understanding of the following:
 * How to name, declare, initialize and assign values to variables within an application.
 * How to use: arithmetic operators to perform arithmetic calculations involving one or more variables; relational operators to test the relationship between two variables or expressions; logical operators to combine expressions that contain relational operators.
 * How to create the code syntax for simple programming statements using C# language keywords and recognize syntax errors using the Visual Studio IDE.
 * How to create a simple branching structure using an IF statement.
 * How to create a simple looping structure using a For statement to iterate through a data array.
 * How to use the Visual Studio IDE to locate simple logic errors.
 * How to create a Function that accepts arguments (parameters and returns a value of a specified type.
 * How to design and build a simple user interface using standard controls from the Visual Studio toolbox.
 * How to connect to a SQL Server database and the basics of how to retrieve and store data.
 * How to sort data in a loop.
 * How to recognize the classes and methods used in a program.
