## 20483 - Training - Programming in C
20483 Training for Microsoft Official Course (MOC) 20483 Programming in C

<br>

### About the course
This training course teaches developers the programming skills that are required for developers to create Windows applications using the Visual C# language.  
During their five days in the classroom students review the basics of Visual C# program structure, language syntax, and implementation details, and then consolidate their knowledge throughout the week as they build an application that incorporates several features of the .NET Framework 4.7.

<br>

### Audience profile
 * This course is intended for experienced developers who already have programming experience in C, C++, JavaScript, Objective-C, Microsoft Visual Basic, or Java and understand the concepts of object-oriented programming.
* This course is not designed for students who are new to programming; it is targeted at professional developers with at least one month of experience programming in an object-oriented environment.
At course completion

### After completing this course, students will be able to:
* Describe the core syntax and features of Visual C#.
* Create methods, handle exceptions, and describe the monitoring requirements of large-scale applications.
* Implement the basic structure and essential elements of a typical desktop application.
* Create classes, define and implement interfaces, and create and use generic collections.
* Use inheritance to create a class hierarchy and to extend a .NET Framework class.
* Read and write data by using file input/output and streams, and serialize and deserialize data in different formats.
* Create and use an entity data model for accessing a database and use LINQ to query data.
* Access and query remote data by using the types in the System.Net namespace and WCF Data Services.
* Build a graphical user interface by using XAML.
* Improve the throughput and response time of applications by using tasks and asynchronous operations.
* Integrate unmanaged libraries and dynamic components into a Visual C# application.
* Examine the metadata of types by using reflection, create and use custom attributes, generate code at runtime, and manage assembly versions.
* Encrypt and decrypt data by using symmetric and asymmetric encryption.

#### Modules details
 
 
 Module | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Module 1: Review of Visual C# Syntax | The Microsoft .NET Framework version 4.7 provides a comprehensive development platform that you can use to build, deploy, and manage applications and services. By using the .NET Framework, you can create visually compelling applications, enable seamless communication across technology boundaries, and provide support for a wide range of business processes. In this module, you will learn about some of the core features provided by the .NET Framework and Microsoft Visual Studio. You will also learn about some of the core Visual C# constructs that enable you to start developing .NET Framework applications.  | --- |
| Module 2: Creating Methods, Handling Exceptions, and Monitoring Applications | Applications often consist of logical units of functionality that perform specific functions, such as providing access to data or triggering some logical processing. Visual C# is an object-orientated language and uses the concept of methods to encapsulate logical units of functionality. A method can be as simple or as complex as you like, and therefore it is important to consider what happens to the state of your application when an exception occurs in a method. In this module, you will learn how to create and use methods and how to handle exceptions. You will also learn how to use logging and tracing to record the details of any exceptions that occur. |
| Module 3: Basic types and constructs of Visual C# | To create effective applications by using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) or other .NET Framework platforms, you must first learn some basic Visual C# constructs. You need to know how to create simple structures to represent the data items you are working with. You need to know how to organize these structures into collections, so that you can add items, retrieve items, and iterate over your items. Finally, you need to know how to subscribe to events so that you can respond to the actions of your users. In this module, you will learn how to create and use structs and enums, organize data into collections, and create and subscribe to events. |
| Module 4: Creating Classes and Implementing Type-Safe Collections | In this module, you will learn how to use interfaces and classes to define and create your own custom, reusable types. You will also learn how to create and use enumerable, type-safe collections of any type. |
| Module 5: Creating a Class Hierarchy by Using Inheritance | In this module, you will learn how to use inheritance to create class hierarchies and to extend .NET Framework types. |
| Module 6: Reading and Writing Local Data | In this module, you will learn how to read and write data by using transactional file system I/O operations, how to serialize and deserialize data to the file system, and how to read and write data to the file system by using streams. |
| Module 7: Accessing a Database | In this module, you will learn how to create and use entity data models (EDMs) and how to query many types of data by using Language-Integrated Query (LINQ). |
| Module 8: Accessing Remote Data | In this module, you will learn how to use the request and response classes in the System.Net namespace to directly manipulate remote data sources. You will also learn how to use Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) Data Services to expose and consume an entity data model (EDM) over the web. |
| Module 9: Designing the User Interface for a Graphical Application| In this module, you will learn how to use Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML) and Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) to create engaging UIs. |
| Module 10: Improving Application Performance and Responsiveness | In this module, you will learn how to improve the performance of your applications by distributing your operations across multiple threads. |
| Module 11: Integrating with Unmanaged Code | In this module, you will learn how to interoperate unmanaged code in your applications and how to ensure that your code releases any unmanaged resources. |
| Module 12: Creating Reusable Types and Assemblies | In this module, you will learn how to consume existing assemblies by using reflection and how to add additional metadata to types and type members by using attributes. You will also learn how to generate code at run time by using the Code Document Object Model (CodeDOM) and how to ensure that your assemblies are signed and versioned, and available to other applications, by using the global assembly cache (GAC). |
| Module 13: Encrypting and Decrypting Data | In this module, you will learn how to implement symmetric and asymmetric encryption and how to use hashes to generate mathematical representations of your data. You will also learn how to create and manage X509 certificates and how to use them in the asymmetric encryption process. |
